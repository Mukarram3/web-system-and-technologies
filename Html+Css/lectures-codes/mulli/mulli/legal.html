            <h4 id="end-user-terms-of-use">ABOUT OUR SERVICES</h4>
            <p>We offer two financial APIs, a Data API and Payment API (both defined below), that let apps and others:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>access its user’s transactional information, account balances and other financial information as
                        described in schedule 1 (the “<strong>Data API</strong>”); and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>initiate payments by automating bank transfers – we initiate payments by securely communicating
                        with the relevant service provider providing such services and instructing such service provider
                        to make payment from the End User’s selected account (the “<strong>Payment API</strong>”).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>With respect to the Payment API, we will initiate payment wherever the End User has provided consent
                through the third-party application unless:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>incomplete or incorrect information has been given;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>applicable laws and regulations do not permit and/or inhibit such action from being taken;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>in our reasonable opinion, the payment may be fraudulent or otherwise unlawful; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>we reasonably believe that the End User is not the named account holder. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our financial APIs have the following use cases, which include (without limitation):</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>categorization of transactional data from multiple bank sources;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>lenders may make instant, informed decisions by accessing streamlined data; </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>verification of account ownership; </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>facilitation of consumer payments;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>categorization of bank data in order to build accounting tools; and </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>initiation of bank transfers. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will not charge you for the use of our Services. However, third-party applications may charge you for
                products and services provided to you that make use of our Services.</p>
            <h4 id="end-user-terms-of-use">Account Information Services</h4>
            <p>You can use our Services to transmit information relating to payment accounts (“<strong>Account
                    Information</strong>”) that you hold with an account servicing payment service provider (i.e. any
                payment service provider such as a bank or credit card issuer that maintains a payment account on your
                behalf) (“<strong>ASPSP</strong>”) to other service providers (the “<strong>Provider</strong>”),
                according to these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p>Before receiving our Services, you will have instructed a third-party application through which you have
                accessed our Services to retrieve your Account Information. Following such instruction, you will
                generally be redirected to us.</p>
            <p>Once you are redirected to us, we will ask you to select which ASPSP you would like us to access Account
                Information from. You may be redirected to your ASPSP’s website or mobile application in order to
                authenticate yourself so that your ASPSP knows that you consent to us accessing your Account
                Information.</p>
            <p>In some circumstances, to use our Services, you will need to provide the same identifying information
                that you use to access the relevant payment accounts when you log in yourself (the
                “<strong>Credentials</strong>”).</p>
            <p>Our Services will allow you to use your Credentials to retrieve such Account Information as you choose to
                transmit to the Provider.</p>
            <p>Our Services may merge or aggregate Account Information retrieved from a particular ASPSP with Account
                Information retrieved from another ASPSP where you have instructed us to access and transmit such
                information.</p>
            <h4 id="end-user-terms-of-use">Payment Initiation Services</h4>
            <p>You can use our Services to make online payments from an account you hold with an ASPSP.</p>
            <p>Before receiving our Services, you will have instructed a third-party application through which you have
                accessed our Services to make an online payment. Following such instruction, you will generally be
                redirected to us.</p>
            <p>Once you are redirected to us, you will be asked to review and confirm your payment and transaction
                details are correct. </p>
            <p>Once you have confirmed those details, and provided your explicit consent for us to:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>send the payment order to your ASPSP for execution; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>share any Account Information we receive from your ASPSP with the third-party application through
                        which you accessed our Services, </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>you will have to select the account you will use to initiate the payment from. You may be redirected to
                your ASPSP’s website or mobile application in order to authenticate yourself so that your ASPSP knows
                that you consent to such transaction.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to introduce new
                services and update or withdraw any of the Services, in our sole discretion, and we will not be liable
                to you for exercising this discretion.</p>
            <h4 id="end-user-terms-of-use">ELIGIBILITY AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</h4>

            <h4>ABOUT OUR SERVICES</h4>
            <p>We offer two financial APIs, a Data API and Payment API (both defined below), that let apps and others:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>access its user’s transactional information, account balances and other financial information as
                        described in schedule 1 (the <strong>“Data API”</strong>); and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>initiate payments by automating bank transfers – we initiate payment by securely communicating
                        with the relevant service provider providing such services and instructing such service provider
                        to make payment from the End User’s selected account (the <strong>“Payment API”</strong>).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>With respect to the Payment API, we will initiate payment wherever the End User has provided consent
                through your Developer App unless:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>incomplete or incorrect information has been given;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>applicable laws and regulations do not permit and/or inhibit such action from being taken;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>in our reasonable opinion, the payment may be fraudulent or otherwise unlawful; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>we reasonably believe that the End User is not the named account holder.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
